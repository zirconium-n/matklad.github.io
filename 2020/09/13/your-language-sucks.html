<h1><span>Your Language Sucks, It Doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t Matter</span> <time class="meta" datetime="2020-09-13">Sep 13, 2020</time></h1>
<p><span>This post describes my own pet theory of programming languages popularity.</span>
<span>My understanding is that no one knows why some languages are popular and others aren</span>&rsquo;<span>t, so there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no harm done if I add my own thoughts to the overall confusion.</span>
<span>Obviously, this is all wild speculation and a just-so story without any kind of data backed research.</span></p>
<p><span>The central thesis is that the actual programming language (syntax, semantics, paradigm) doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t really matter.</span>
<span>What matters is characteristics of the runtime </span>&mdash;<span> roughly, what does memory of the running process look like?</span></p>
<p><span>To start, an observation.</span>
<span>A lot of software is written in vimscript and emacs lisp (</span><a href="https://magit.vc/"><span>magit</span></a><span> being one example I can</span>&rsquo;<span>t live without).</span>
<span>And these languages are objectively bad.</span>
<span>This happens even with less esoteric technologies, notable examples being PHP and JavaScript.</span>
<span>While JavaScript is great in some aspects (it</span>&rsquo;<span>s the first mainstream language with lambdas!), it surely isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t hard to imagine a trivially better version of it (for example, without two different </span><code>null</code><span>s).</span></p>
<p><span>This is a general rule </span>&mdash;<span> as soon as you have a language which is Turing-complete, and has some capabilities for building abstractions, people will just get the things done with it.</span>
<span>Surely, some languages are more productive, some are less productive, but, overall, FP vs OOP vs static types vs dynamic types doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t seem super relevant.</span>
<span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s always possible to overcome the language by spending some more time writing a program.</span></p>
<p><span>In contrast, overcoming language runtime is not really possible.</span>
<span>If you want to extend vim, you kinda have to use vimscript.</span>
<span>If you want your code to run in the browser, JavaScript is still the best bet.</span>
<span>Need to embed your code anywhere? GC is probably not an option for you.</span></p>
<p><span>This two observations lead to the following hypothesis:</span></p>

<aside class="admn note">
<svg class="icon"><use href="/assets/icons.svg#info"/></svg>
<div><p><span>Languages generally become popular when they bring innovative runtime, or when they have runtime exclusivity.</span>
<span>The quality of the language itself is secondary.</span></p>
</div>
</aside><p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s see some examples which can be </span>&ldquo;<span>explained</span>&rdquo;<span> by this theory.</span></p>
<dl>
<dt><span>C</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>C has a pretty spartan runtime, which is notable for two reasons.</span>
<span>First, it was the first fast enough runtime for a high-level language.</span>
<span>It was possible to write the OS kernel in C, which had been typically done in assembly before that for performance.</span>
<span>Second, C is the language of Unix.</span>
<span>(And yes, I would put C into the </span>&ldquo;<span>easily improved upon</span>&rdquo;<span> category of languages. Null-terminated strings are just a bad design).</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>JavaScript</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>This language has been exclusive in the browsers for quite some time.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Java</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>This case I think is the most interesting for the theory.</span>
<span>A common explanation for Java</span>&rsquo;<span>s popularity is </span>&ldquo;<span>marketing by Sun</span>&rdquo;<span>, and subsequent introduction of Java into University</span>&rsquo;<span>s curricula.</span>
<span>This doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t seem convincing to me.</span>
<span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s look at the 90</span>&rsquo;<span>s popular languages (I am not sure about percentage and relative ranking here, but the composition seems broadly correct to me):</span></p>

<figure>
<figcaption class="title">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og847HVwRSI</figcaption>

<img alt="" src="/assets/lang-pop.png">
</figure>
<p><span>On this list, Java is the only non-dynamic cross-platform memory safe language.</span>
<span>That is, Java is both memory safe (no manual error-prone memory management) and can be implemented reasonably efficiently (field access is a load and not a dictionary lookup).</span>
<span>This seems like a pretty compelling reason to choose Java, irrespective of what the language itself actually looks like.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Go</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>One can argue whether focus on simplicity at the expense of everything else is good or bad, but statically linked zero dependency binaries definitely were a reason for Go popularity in the devops sphere.</span>
<span>In a sense, Go is an upgrade over </span>&ldquo;<span>memory safe &amp; reasonably fast</span>&rdquo;<span> Java runtime, when you no longer need to install JVM separately.</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><span>Naturally, there are also some things which are not explained by my hypothesis.</span>
<span>One is scripting languages.</span>
<span>A highly dynamic runtime with </span><code>eval</code><span> and ability to easily link C extensions indeed would be a differentiator, so we would expect a popular scripting language.</span>
<span>However, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s unclear why they are Python and PHP, and not Ruby and Perl.</span></p>
<p><span>Another one is language evolutions: C++ and TypeScript don</span>&rsquo;<span>t innovate runtime-wise, yet they are still major languages.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, let</span>&rsquo;<span>s make some bold predictions using the theory.</span></p>
<p><em><span>First</span></em><span>, I expect Rust to become a major language, naturally :)</span>
<span>This needs some explanation </span>&mdash;<span> on the first blush, Rust is runtime-equivalent to C and C++, so the theory should predict just the opposite.</span>
<span>But I would argue that memory safety is a runtime property, despite the fact that it is, uniquely to Rust, achieved exclusively via language machinery.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Second</span></em><span>, I predict Julia to become more popular.</span>
<span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s pretty unique, runtime-wise, with its stark rejection of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout's_dichotomy"><span>Ousterhout</span>&rsquo;<span>s Dichotomy</span></a><span> and insisting that, yeah, we</span>&rsquo;<span>ll just JIT highly dynamic language to suuuper fast numeric code at runtime.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Third</span></em><span>, I wouldn</span>&rsquo;<span>t be surprised if Dart grows.</span>
<span>On the one hand, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s roughly in the same boat as Go and Java, with memory safe runtime with fixed layout of objects and pervasive dynamic dispatch.</span>
<span>But the quality of implementation of the runtimes is staggering: it has first-class JIT, AOT and JS compilers.</span>
<span>Moreover, it has top-notch hot-reload support.</span>
<span>Nothing here is a breakthrough, but the combination is impressive.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Fourth</span></em><span>, I predict that Nim, Crystal and Zig (which is very interesting, language design wise) would not become popular.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Fifth</span></em><span>, I predict that Swift will be pretty popular on Apple hardware due to platform exclusivity, but won</span>&rsquo;<span>t grow much outside of it, </span><em><span>despite</span></em><span> being very innovative in language design (generics in Swift are the opposite of the generics in Go).</span></p>
