<h1><span>Why an IDE?</span> <time class="meta" datetime="2020-11-11">Nov 11, 2020</time></h1>
<p><span>Some time ago I wrote a reddit comment explaining the benefits of IDEs.</span>
<span>Folks refer to it from time to time, so I decided to edit it into an article form.</span>
<span>Enjoy!</span></p>
<p><span>I think I have a rather balanced perspective on IDEs.</span>
<span>I used to be a heavy Emacs user (</span><a href="https://github.com/matklad/.emacs.d/tree/475de5db99f8729c57fed7e6fde4cd06f5ccb62f"><span>old config</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/d555642a5a9e4e8b0ca0c77f188ffd976f06327c/home/.emacs.d/init.el"><span>current config</span></a><span>).</span>
<span>I worked at JetBrains on </span><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust"><span>IntelliJ Rust</span></a><span> for several years.</span>
<span>I used evil mode and vim for a bit, and tried tmux and kakoune.</span>
<span>Nowadays, I primarily use VS Code to develop </span><a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/"><span>rust-analyzer</span></a><span>: LSP-based editor-independent IDE backend for Rust.</span></p>
<p><span>I will be focusing on IntelliJ family of IDEs, as I believe these are the most advanced IDEs today.</span></p>
<p><span>The main distinguishing feature of IntelliJ is semantic understanding of code.</span>
<span>The core of IntelliJ is a compiler which parses, type checks and otherwise understands your code.</span>
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PostIntelliJ.html"><span>PostIntelliJ</span></a><span> is the canonical post about this.</span>
<span>That article also refutes the claim that </span>&ldquo;<span>Smalltalk IDE is the best we</span>&rsquo;<span>ve ever had</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that </span>&ldquo;<span>semantic understanding</span>&rdquo;<span> is mostly unrelated to the traditional interpretation of </span>&ldquo;<span>IDE</span>&rdquo;<span> as </span><em><em><span>Integrated</span></em></em><span> Development Environment.</span>
<span>I personally don</span>&rsquo;<span>t feel that the </span>&ldquo;<span>Integrated</span>&rdquo;<span> bit is all that important.</span>
<span>I commit&amp;push from the command line using Julia scripts, rebase in magit, and do code reviews in a browser.</span>
<span>If anything, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s an ample room for improvement for the integration bits.</span>
<span>For me, </span><strong><strong><span>I</span></strong></strong><span> in </span>&ldquo;<strong><span>I</span></strong><span>DE</span>&rdquo;<span> stands for </span>&ldquo;<span>intelligent</span>&rdquo;<span>, smart.</span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind this terminology difference.</span>
<span>I feel it is a common source of misunderstanding.</span>
&ldquo;<span>Unix and command line can do anything an IDE can do</span>&rdquo;<span> is correct about integrated bits, but is wrong about semantical bits.</span></p>
<p><span>Traditional editors like Vim or Emacs understand programming languages very approximately, mostly via regular expressions.</span>
<span>For me, this feels very wrong.</span>
<span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454"><span>common knowledge</span></a><span> that HTML shall not be parsed with regex.</span>
<span>Yet this is exactly what happens every time one does </span><code>vim index.html</code><span> with syntax highlighting on.</span>
<span>I sincerely think that almost every syntax highlighter out there is wrong and we, as an industry, should do better.</span>
<span>I also understand that this is a tall order, but I do my best to change the status quo here :-)</span></p>
<p><span>These are mostly theoretical concerns though.</span>
<span>The question is, does semantic understanding help in practice?</span>
<span>I am pretty sure that it is non-essential, especially for smaller code bases.</span>
<span>My </span><a href="https://github.com/matklad/rustraytracer"><span>first non-trivial Rust program</span></a><span> was written in Emacs, and it was fine.</span>
<span>Most of rust-analyzer was written using pretty spartan IDE support.</span>
<span>There are a lot of insanely-productive folks who are like </span>&ldquo;<span>sometimes I type vim, sometimes I type vi, they are sufficiently similar</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span>
<span>Regex-based syntax highlighting and regex based fuzzy symbol search (</span><a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags"><span>ctags</span></a><span>) get you a really long way.</span></p>
<p><span>However, I do believe that features unlocked by deep understanding of the language help.</span>
<span>The funniest example here is extend/shrink selection.</span>
<span>This features allows you to extend current selection to the next encompassing syntactic construct.</span>
<span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s the simplest feature a PostIntelliJ IDE can have, it only needs the parser.</span>
<span>But it is sooo helpful when writing code, it just completely blows vim</span>&rsquo;<span>s text objects out of the water, especially when combined with multiple cursors.</span>
<span>In a sense, this is structural editing which works for text.</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span>If you add further knowledge of the language into a mix, you</span>&rsquo;<span>ll get the </span>&ldquo;<span>assists</span>&rdquo;<span> system: micro-refactoring which available in a particular context.</span>
<span>For example, if the cursor is on a comma in a list of function arguments, you can </span><kbd><kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd></kbd><span> &gt; </span>&ldquo;<span>swap arguments</span>&rdquo;<span>, and the order of arguments will be changed in the declaration and on various call-sites as well.</span>
<span>(See </span><a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/09/28/how-to-make-a-light-bulb.html"><span>this post</span></a><span> to learn how assists are implemented).</span></p>
<p><span>These small dwim things add up to a really nice editing experience, where you mostly express the intention, and the IDE deals with boring syntactical aspects of code editing:</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span>For larger projects, complex refactors are a huge time-saver.</span>
<span>Doing project-wide renames and signature changes automatically and without thinking reduces the cost of keeping the code clean.</span></p>
<p><span>Another transformative experience is navigation.</span>
<span>In IntelliJ, you generally don</span>&rsquo;<span>t </span>&ldquo;<span>open a file</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span>
<span>Instead you think directly in terms of functions, types and modules, and navigate to those using file structure, goto symbol, to do definition/implementation/type, etc:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/navigating-through-the-source-code.html" class="url">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/navigating-through-the-source-code.html</a></p>
<p><span>When I used Emacs, I really admired its buffer management facilities, because they made opening a file I want a breeze.</span>
<span>When I later switched to IntelliJ, I stopped thinking in terms of a set of opened files altogether.</span>
<span>I disabled editor tabs and started using editor splits less often </span>&mdash;<span> you don</span>&rsquo;<span>t need bookmarks if you can just find things.</span></p>
<p><span>For me, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s one aspect of traditional editors which is typically not matched in IDEs out of the box </span>&mdash;<span> basic cursor motion.</span>
<span>Using arrow keys for that is slow and flow-breaking, because one needs to move the hand from the home row.</span>
<span>Even Emacs</span>&rsquo;<span> horrific </span><kbd><kbd>C-p</kbd></kbd><span>, </span><kbd><kbd>C-n</kbd></kbd><span> are a big improvement, and vim</span>&rsquo;<span>s </span><kbd><kbd>hjkl</kbd></kbd><span> go even further.</span>
<span>One fix here is to configure each tool to use your favorite shortcuts, but this is a whack-a-mole game.</span>
<span>What I do is remapping </span><kbd><kbd>CapsLock</kbd></kbd><span> to act as an extra modifier, such that </span><kbd><kbd>ijkl</kbd></kbd><span> </span><strong><span>are</span></strong><span> arrow keys.</span>
<span>(There are also keyboards with </span><a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com"><span>hardware</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://ergodox-ez.com"><span>support</span></a><span> for this).</span>
<span>This works in all applications the same way.</span>
<span>Easy motion / ace jump functionality for jumping to any visible character is also handy, and usually is available </span><a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9803-acejump-lite"><span>via</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucax88x.codeacejumper"><span>a plugin</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Recent advancements with LSP protocol promise to give one the best of both worlds, where semantic-aware backend and light-weight editor frontend are different processes, which can be mixed and matched.</span>
<span>This is nice in theory, but not as nice in practice as IntelliJ yet, mostly because IntelliJ is way more polished.</span></p>
<p><span>To give a simple example, in IntelliJ for </span>&ldquo;<span>go to symbol by fuzzy name</span>&rdquo;<span> functionality, I can filter the search scope by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>is this my code/code from a dependency?</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>is this test/production code?</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>is a symbol a type-like thing, or a method-like thing?</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>path to the module where the symbol is defined.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>VS Code and LSP simply do not have capabilities for such filters yet, they have to be bolted on using hacks.</span>
<span>Support for LSP in other editors is even more hit-and-miss.</span></p>
<p><span>LSP did achieve a significant breakthrough </span>&mdash;<span> it made people care about implementing IDE backends.</span>
<span>Experience shows that re-engineering an existing compiler to power an IDE is often impossible, or isomorphic to a rewrite.</span>
<span>How a compiler talks to an editor is the smaller problem.</span>
<span>The hard one is building a compiler that can do IDE stuff in the first place.</span>
<span>Check out </span><a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html"><span>this post</span></a><span> for some of the technical details.</span>
<span>Starting with this use-case in mind saves a lot of effort down the road.</span></p>
<p><span>This I think is a big deal.</span>
<span>I hypothesize that the reason why IDEs do not completely dominate tooling landscape is the lack of good IDE backends.</span></p>
<p><span>If we look at the set of languages fairly popular recently, a significant fraction of them is dynamically typed: PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby.</span>
<span>The helpfulness of an IDE for dynamically typed languages is severely limited: while approximations and heuristics can get you a long way, you still need humans in the loop to verify IDE</span>&rsquo;<span>s guesses.</span></p>
<p><span>There</span>&rsquo;<span>s C++, but its templates are effectively dynamically typed, with exactly the same issues (and a very complex base language to boot).</span>
<span>Curiously, C looks like a language for which implementing a near-perfect IDE is pretty feasible.</span>
<span>I don</span>&rsquo;<span>t know why it didn</span>&rsquo;<span>t happen before CLion.</span></p>
<p><span>This leaves C# and Java.</span>
<span>Indeed, these languages are dominated by IDEs.</span>
<span>There</span>&rsquo;<span>s a saying that you can</span>&rsquo;<span>t write Java without an IDE.</span>
<span>I think it gets the causation direction backwards: Java is one of the few languages for which it is possible to implement a great IDE without great pain.</span>
<span>Supporting evidence here is Go.</span>
<span>According to </span><a href="https://go.dev/blog/survey2019-results#developer-tools"><span>survey results</span></a><span>, text editors are stably declining in popularity in favor of IDEs.</span></p>
<p><span>I think this is because Go actually has good IDEs.</span>
<span>This is possible because the language is sufficiently statically typed for an IDE to be a marked improvement.</span>
<span>Additionally, the language is very simple, so the amount of work you need to put in to make a decent IDE is much lower than for other languages.</span>
<span>If you have something like JavaScript</span>&hellip;
<span>Well, you first need to build an alternative language for which you can actually implement an IDE (</span><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"><span>TypeScript</span></a><span>) and only then you can build the IDE itself (</span><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode"><span>VS Code</span></a><span>).</span></p>
