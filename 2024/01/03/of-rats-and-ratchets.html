<h1><span>Of Rats and Ratchets</span> <time class="meta" datetime="2024-01-03">Jan 3, 2024</time></h1>
<p><span>This is going to be related to software engineering, pinky promise!</span></p>
<p><span>I was re-reading Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak recently. It is a beautiful novel set in Russia</span>
<span>during the revolutionary years before World War II. It focuses on the life of Yuri Zhivago, a doctor</span>
<span>and a poet, while the Russian revolutions roar in the background. It is a poignant and topical tale</span>
<span>of a country descending into blood-thirsty madness.</span></p>
<p><span>Being a doctor, a literati, and a descendant of once wealthy family, Zhivago is not exactly welcomed</span>
<span>in the new Russia. That</span>&rsquo;<span>s why a significant part of the novel takes place far away from Moscow and</span>
<span>St. Petersburg, in Siberia, where it is easier for undesirables to exist in a fragile truce with the</span>
<span>state.</span></p>
<p><span>What</span>&rsquo;<span>s your first problem, if you are going to live in someone else</span>&rsquo;<span>s abandoned house in Siberia,</span>
<span>eking out a living off whatever supplies had been left? The rats, who are also very keen on the said</span>
<span>supplies. Clearly, rats are a big problem, and require immediate attention.</span></p>
<p><span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s easy to exert effort and get rid of the rats </span>&mdash;<span> take a broom, some light source, and just</span>
<span>chase away the rascals from the house. However observably effective the method is, it is not a</span>
<span>solution </span>&mdash;<span> the rats will come back as soon as you are asleep. The proper solution starts with</span>
<span>identifying all the holes through which the pest gets in, and thoroughly plugging those! Only then</span>
<span>can you hope that the house </span><em><span>stays</span></em><span> rat free.</span></p>
<p><span>I feel the dynamics plays out in software projects. There</span>&rsquo;<span>s lots of rats, everything</span>&rsquo;<span>s broken and in</span>
<span>need of fixing, all the time. And there</span>&rsquo;<span>s usually plenty of desire and energy to fix things. The</span>
<span>problem is, often times the fixes are not durable </span>&mdash;<span> an immediate problem is resolved promptly, but</span>
<span>then it returns back two years down the line. This is most apparent in benchmarks </span>&mdash;<span> everyone loves</span>
<span>adding a microbenchmark to motivate a particular change, and then the benchmark bitrots with no one</span>
<span>to run it.</span></p>
<p><span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s important not only to fix things, but to fix them in a durable way; to seal up the holes, not</span>
<span>just to wave the broom vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span>The best way to do this is to setup a not rocket science rule, and then to use it as a ratchet to</span>
<span>monotonically increase the set of properties the codebase possesses, one small check at a time.</span>
<span>Crucially, the ratchet should be set up up front, </span><em><span>before</span></em><span> any of the problems are actually fixed,</span>
<span>and it must allow for incremental steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s say you lack documentation, and want to ensure that every file in the code-base has a</span>
<span>top-level comment explaining  the relevant context. A good way to approach this problem is to write</span>
<span>a test that reads every file in the project, computes the set of poorly documented files, and xors</span>
<span>that against the hard-coded naughty list. This test is then committed to the project with the</span>
<span>naughty list encompassing all the existing files. Although no new docs are added, the ratchet is in</span>
<span>place </span>&mdash;<span> all new files are guaranteed to be documented. And its easier to move a notch up the</span>
<span>ratchet by documenting a single file and crossing it out from the naughty list.</span></p>
<p><span>More generally, widen your view of tests </span>&mdash;<span> a test is a program that checks a property of a</span>
<span>repository of code at a particular commit. Any property </span>&mdash;<span> code style, absence of warnings,</span>
<span>licenses of dependencies, the maximum size of any binary file committed into the repository,</span>
<span>presence of unwanted merge commits, average assertion density.</span></p>
<p><span>Not everything can be automated though. For things which can</span>&rsquo;<span>t be, the best trick I</span>&rsquo;<span>ve found is</span>
<span>writing them down. </span><em><span>Just</span></em><span> agreeing that </span><em><span>X</span></em><span> is a team practice is not enough, even if it </span><em><span>might</span></em>
<span>work for the first six months. Only when </span><em><span>X</span></em><span> is written down in a markdown document inside a</span>
<span>repository it might becomes a durable practice. But beware </span>&mdash;<span> document what </span><em><span>is</span></em><span>, rather than what</span>
<em><span>should</span></em><span> be. If there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a clear disagreement between what the docs say the world is, and the actual</span>
<span>world, the ratcheting effect of the written word disappears. If there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a large diff between reality</span>
<span>and documentation, don</span>&rsquo;<span>t hesitate to remove conflicting parts of the documentation. Having a ratchet</span>
<span>that enforces a tiny set of properties is much more valuable than aspirations to enforce everything.</span></p>
<p><span>Coming back to Doctor Zhivago, it is worth noting that the novel is arranged into a myriad of</span>
<span>self-contained small chapters </span>&mdash;<span> a blessing for a modern attention-deprived world, as it creates a</span>
<span>clear sense of progression even when you don</span>&rsquo;<span>t have enough focus to get lost in a book for hours.</span></p>
