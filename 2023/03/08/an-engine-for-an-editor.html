<h1><span>An Engine For An Editor</span> <time class="meta" datetime="2023-03-08">Mar 8, 2023</time></h1>
<p><span>A common trope is how, if one wants to build a game, one should build a game, rather than a game engine, because it is all too easy to fall into a trap of building a generic solution, without getting to the game proper.</span>
<span>It seems to me that the situation with code editors is the opposite </span>&mdash;<span> many people build editors, but few are building </span>&ldquo;<span>editor engines</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span>
<span>What</span>&rsquo;<span>s an </span>&ldquo;<span>editor engine</span>&rdquo;<span>? A made up term I use to denote a </span><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2022/02/diagrams.html"><dfn><span>thin waist</span></dfn></a><span> the editor is build upon, the set of core concepts, entities and APIs which power the variety of editor</span>&rsquo;<span>s components.</span>
<span>In this post, I will highlight Emacs</span>&rsquo;<span> thin waist, which I think is worthy of imitation!</span></p>
<p><span>Before we get to Emacs, lets survey various APIs for building interactive programs.</span></p>
<dl>
<dt><span>Plain text</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>The simplest possible thing, the UNIX way of programs-filters, reading input from stdin and writing data to stdout.</span>
<span>The language here is just plain text.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>ANSI escape sequences</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Adding escape codes to plain text (and a bunch of </span><code>ioctl</code><span>s) allows changing colors and clearing the screen.</span>
<span>The language becomes a sequence of commands for the terminal (with </span>&ldquo;<span>print text</span>&rdquo;<span> being a fairly frequent one).</span>
<span>This already is rich enough to power a variety of terminal applications, such as vim!</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>HTML</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>With more structure, we can disentangle ourselves from text, and say that all the stuff is made of trees of attributed elements (whose content might be text).</span>
<span>That turns out to be enough to express basically whatever, as the world of modern web apps testifies.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Canvas</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Finally, to achieve maximal flexibility, we can start with a clean 2d canvas with pixels and an event stream, and let the app draw however it likes.</span>
<span>Desktop GUIs usually work that way (using some particular widget library to encapsulate common patterns of presentation and event handling).</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr>
<p><span>Emacs is different.</span>
<span>Its thin waist consists of (using idiosyncratic olden editor terminology) frames, windows, buffers and attributed text.</span>
<span>This is </span><em><span>less</span></em><span> general than canvas or HTML, but more general (and way more principled) than ANSI escapes.</span>
<span>Crucially, this also retains most of plain text</span>&rsquo;<span>s </span><em><span>composability</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The foundation is a text with attributes </span>&mdash;<span> a pair of a string and a map from string</span>&rsquo;<span>s subranges to key-value dictionaries.</span>
<span>Attributes express presentation (color, font, text decoration), but also semantics.</span>
<span>A range of text can be designated as clickable.</span>
<span>Or it can specify a custom keymap, which is only active when the cursor is on this range.</span></p>
<p><span>I find this to be a sweet spot for building efficient user interfaces.</span>
<span>Consider </span><a href="https://magit.vc"><span>magit</span></a><span>:</span></p>

<figure>

<img alt="" src="/assets/magit.png">
</figure>
<p><span>The interface is built from text, but it is more discoverable, more readable, and more efficient than GUI solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>Text is </span><a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html"><span>surprisingly good</span></a><span> at communicating with humans!</span>
<span>Forgoing arbitrary widgets and restricting oneself to a grid of characters greatly constrains the set of possible designs, but designs which come out of these constraints tend to be better.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>The rest (buffers, windows, and frames) serve to present attributed strings to the user.</span>
<span>A Buffer holds a piece of text and stores position of the cursor (and the rest of editor</span>&rsquo;<span>s state for this particular piece of text).</span>
<span>A tiling window manager displays buffers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a set of floating windows (frames in Emacs terminology) managed by a desktop environment</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>each floating window is subdivided into a tree of vertical and horizontal splits (windows) managed by Emacs</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>each split displays a buffer, although some buffers might not have a corresponding split</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>There</span>&rsquo;<span>s also a tasteful selection of extras outside this orthogonal model.</span>
<span>A buffer holds a status bar at the bottom and a set of fringe decorations at the left edge.</span>
<span>Each floating window has a minibuffer </span>&mdash;<span> an area to type commands into (minibuffer </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> a buffer though </span>&mdash;<span> only presentation is slightly unusual).</span></p>
<p><span>But the vast majority of everything else is not special </span>&mdash;<span> every significant thing is a buffer.</span>
<span>So, </span><code>./main.rs</code><span> file, </span><code>./src</code><span> file tree, a terminal session where you type </span><code>cargo build</code><span> are all displayed as attributed text.</span>
<span>All use the same tools for navigation and manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span>Universality is the power of the model.</span>
<span>Good old UNIX pipes, except interactive.</span>
<span>With a GUI file manager, mass-renaming files requires </span><a href="https://apps.kde.org/krename/"><span>a dedicated utility</span></a><span>.</span>
<span>In Emacs, file manager</span>&rsquo;<span>s state is text, so you can use standard text-manipulation tools (regexes, multiple cursors, vim</span>&rsquo;<span>s </span><kbd><kbd>.</kbd></kbd><span>) for the same task.</span></p>

    <a href="#Conclusions"><span>Conclusions</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Pay more attention to the editor</span>&rsquo;<span>s thin waist.</span>
<span>Don</span>&rsquo;<span>t take it as a given that an editor should be a terminal, HTML, or GUI app </span>&mdash;<span> there might be a better vocabulary.</span>
<span>In particular, Emacs seems to hit the sweet spot with its language of attributed strings and buffers.</span></p>
<p><span>I am not sure that Emacs is the best we can do, but having a Rust library which implements Emacs model more or less as is would be nice!</span>
<span>The two best resources to learn about this model are</span></p>
