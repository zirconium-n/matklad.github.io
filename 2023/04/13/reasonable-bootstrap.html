<h1><span>Reasonable Bootstrap</span> <time class="meta" datetime="2023-04-13">Apr 13, 2023</time></h1>
<p><span>Compilers for systems programming languages (C, C++, Rust, Zig) tend to be implemented in the languages themselves.</span>
<span>The idea being that the current version of the compiler is built using some previous version.</span>
<span>But how can you get a working compiler if you start out from nothing?</span></p>
<p><span>The traditional answer has been </span>&ldquo;<span>via bootstrap chain</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span>
<span>You start with the first version of the compiler implemented in assembly, use that to compile the latest version of the compiler it is capable of compiling, then repeat.</span>
<span>This historically worked OK because older versions of GCC were implemented in C (and C is easy to provide a compiler for) and, even today, GCC itself is very conservative in using language features.</span>
<span>I believe GCC 10.4 released in 2022 can be built with just a C++98 compiler.</span>
<span>So, if you start with a C compiler, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s not too many hops to get to the latest GCC.</span></p>
<p><span>This doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t feel entirely satisfactory, as this approach requires artificially constraining the compiler itself to be very conservative.</span>
<span>Rust does the opposite of that.</span>
<span>Rust requires that rustc 1.x.0 is built by rustc 1.x-1.0, and there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a new rustc version every six weeks.</span>
<span>This seems like a very reasonable way to build compilers, </span><em><span>but</span></em><span> it also is incompatible with chain bootstrapping.</span>
<span>In the limit, one would need infinite time to compile modern rustc ex nihilo!</span></p>
<p><span>I </span><em><span>think</span></em><span> there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a better way if the goal is to compile the world from nothing.</span>
<span>To cut to the chase, the minimal bootstrap seed for Rust could be:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>source code for current version of the compiler</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>this source code compiled to core WebAssembly</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Bootstrapping from this should be easy.</span>
<span>WebAssembly is a very small language, so a runtime for it can be built out of nothing.</span>
<span>Using this runtime, and rustc-compiled-to-wasm we can re-compile rustc itself.</span>
<span>Then, we can either cross-compile it to the architecture we need, if that architecture is supported by rustc.</span>
<span>If the architecture is </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> supported, we can implement a new backend for that arch in Rust, compile our modified compiler to wasm, and then cross-compile to the desired target.</span></p>
<p><span>More complete bootstrap seed would include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Informal specification of the Rust language, to make sense of the source code.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Rust source code for the compiler, which also doubles as a formal specification of the language.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Informal specification of WebAssembly, to make sense of .wasm parts of the bootstrap seed.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>.wasm code for the rust compiler, which triple-checks the Rust specification.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Rust implementation of a WebAssembly interpreter, which doubles as a formal spec for WebAssembly.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>And this seed is provided for every version of a language.</span>
<span>This way, it is possible to bootstrap, in constant time, any version of Rust.</span></p>
<p><span>Specific properties we use for this setup:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Compilation is deterministic.</span>
<span>Compiling bootstrap sources with bootstrap .wasm blob should result in a byte-for-byte identical wasm blob.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>WebAssembly is target-agnostic.</span>
<span>It describes abstract computation, which is completely independent from the host architecture.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>WebAssembly is simple.</span>
<span>Implementing a WebAssembly interpreter is easy in whatever computation substrate you have.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Compiler is a cross compiler.</span>
<span>We don</span>&rsquo;<span>t want to bootstrap </span><em><span>just</span></em><span> the WebAssembly backend, we want to bootstrap everything.</span>
<span>This requires that the WebAssembly version of the compiler can generate the code for arbitrary architectures.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>This setup does not prevent the trusting trust attack.</span>
<span>However, it is possible to rebuild the bootstrap seed using a different compiler.</span>
<span>Using that compiler to compiler rustc to .wasm will produce a different blob.</span>
<span>But using that .wasm to recompile rustc again should produce the blob from the seed (unless, of course, there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a trojan in the seed).</span></p>
<p><span>This setup does not minimize the size of opaque binary blobs in the seed.</span>
<span>The size of the .wasm would be substantial.</span>
<span>This setup, however, does minimize the total size of the seed.</span>
<span>In the traditional bootstrap, source code for rustc 1.0.0, rustc 1.1.0, rustc 1.2.0, etc would also have to be part of the seed.</span>
<span>For the suggested approach, you need only one version, at the cost of a bigger binary blob.</span></p>
<p><span>This idea is not new.</span>
<span>I </span><em><span>think</span></em><span> it was popularized by Pascal with p-code.</span>
<span>OCaml uses a similar strategy.</span>
<span>Finally, </span><a href="https://ziglang.org/news/goodbye-cpp/"><span>Zig</span></a><span> makes an important observation that we no longer need to implement language-specific virtual machines, because WebAssembly is a good fit for the job.</span></p>
