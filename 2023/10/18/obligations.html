<h1><span>Unless Explicitly Specified Otherwise, Open Source Software With Users Carries Moral Obligations</span> <time class="meta" datetime="2023-10-18">Oct 18, 2023</time></h1>
<p><span>My thoughts on the topic of whether maintainers owe you anything. Speaking as an author, a maintainer,</span>
<span>a user of, and a contributor to open-source software.</span></p>
<p><span>Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s start with a thing which I find obvious and non-negotiable: I can</span>&rsquo;<span>t lie in my README.md.</span></p>
<p><span>I can</span>&rsquo;<span>t write </span>&ldquo;<span>this software is reliable, fast, and secure</span>&rdquo;<span> if in fact my software is slow,</span>
<span>crashes, and comes with a backdoor pre-installed. More generally, if I promise something in the</span>
<span>readme, I</span>&rsquo;<span>d better follow up on the promise and be ready to apologize if I fail.</span></p>
<p><span>If I create expectations between me and my users, I am on the hook for conforming to them.</span></p>
<p><span>The subtle point here is, if I make an Open Source Project, push it to some forge, write a nice</span>
<span>readme explaining why one would want to use it, provide one-liner for installation, and publish</span>
<span>builds to some package registries, I am already creating some expectations. The act of inviting</span>
<span>users (and writing usage instructions aimed at a general audience </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> an act of inviting users)</span>
<span>forms an agreement between me as a maintainer and the user.</span></p>
<p><span>Expectations, but how great? Let</span>&rsquo;<span>s say that tomorrow at this place I am run over by an automobile.</span>
<span>That would be a tragedy for many reasons! But should I worry, on top of all that, that I can no</span>
<span>longer swiftly react to vulnerabilities reported against my open-source software? Obviously not! And</span>
<span>that</span>&rsquo;<span>s the bound on expectations here: it is absolutely ok for a maintainer to do absolutely</span>
<span>nothing.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, if I publish a project, write a nice readme, provide installation instructions,</span>
<span>etc, and then add a backdoor to my software, I am wrong. Yes, I didn</span>&rsquo;<span>t explicitly mention in the</span>
<span>readme that I am not going to add a backdoor. Still, there is a basic, implicit expectation about</span>
<span>software security, and it is wrong for me to violate it without an explicit mention.</span></p>
<p><span>So I think the default expectations for a published open-source project boil down to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>As a maintainer, I can do absolutely nothing, and that</span>&rsquo;<span>s OK.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>At the same time, I can not be actively hostile to my users.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>I can spell out any extra carve-outs in either direction in my README.md.</span>
<span>E.g., if I promise that releases follow SemVer, I should try to make it so! Conversely, if I am</span>
<span>implementing my own crypto for fun for credentials-handling software, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s ok for me to just</span>
<span>prominently mention that in the documentation.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>What about the license? Doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t it say that THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED </span>&ldquo;<span>AS IS</span>&rdquo;<span>, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF</span>
<span>ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED?</span></p>
<p><span>It does, but that</span>&rsquo;<span>s a statement about legality, not ethicality. If my readme says that my software</span>
<span>is fit for a particular purpose, while it actually (and subtly) isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t in a big way, my users have</span>
<span>the moral right to be mad at me. They don</span>&rsquo;<span>t have the legal right to sue me though.</span></p>
<p><span>So, if you, as an open-source maintainer, publish your software and gain users, you should ask</span>
<span>yourself: </span>&ldquo;<span>do I actually want to have users?</span>&rdquo;<span>. It is totally fine if the answer is </span>&ldquo;<span>no</span>&rdquo;<span>! It is a</span>
<span>safe default answer and what governs most of the git repositories out there.</span></p>
<p><span>Never the less, if the answer to question of users is </span>&ldquo;<span>no</span>&rdquo;<span>, you should make it clear in your Readme</span>
<span>that it is a hobby, non-production-ready project which isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t intended to be used by anyone but you.</span>
<span>Usually, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s enough to just not have a readme at all, or have a very short readme which makes it</span>
<span>obvious that the project isn</span>&rsquo;<span>t supported.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if you do have a nice README with installation instructions and such, that constitutes a</span>
&ldquo;<span>yes</span>&rdquo;<span> answer. And then you, as a maintainer, are responsible for a tiny bit of life of your</span>
<span>explicitly invited users. It</span>&rsquo;<span>s not expected that you do much (in fact, doing nothing is totally OK),</span>
<span>but the amount of expectation is greater than zero.</span></p>
